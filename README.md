# Equivalent-Automatons
On this exercise it will be implemented a short development of an application that could receive two automatons and determinate if those are equivalent. 

the automatons could be Mealy or Moore machines.

the proposal is to make two tabs. The first to register all the data needed for the machines, called *****tab, and the other one to see on more detail the process, know as result tab. 

the process will start with the specification of the number of states, the type of machine, and then after all the information is verified on the correct format, the user can press a button to know is the machines are or not equivalent.

The solution will be implemented on javafx, and for the interface we are going to use scene builder app.
